#Pop Mart #Blind Box Hidden #labubu One Piece #My Blind Box Sharing #Daily Blind Box Disassembly My husband’s favorite dolls have finally settled down. I paired with the Lego Pirate Ship I used to fight for. I feel like it. I like #labubu My husband likes #One Piece. I have been looking for a long time. I have found many stores but I have no goods. I have no box machines. Who would have thought of passing by the box machines when I went shopping. I happened to meet the staff who were loading the goods. I watched 12 of them. As soon as the staff left, my husband ran to push them excitedly. I didn’t think about buying too much at the beginning, so I bought 4. I just wanted to drive out #Luffy or #Chopa. The result was not very much. But without repeating this, we had a premonition that the goods on it were definitely a whole box. I simply pushed them all and pushed them to the 7th. My son opened his little hand and opened it to hide‼ ️Instantly exclaimed. Who knows how to feel hidden for the first time after entering the pit for so long? I am still the box machine. I have been driven one after another. I found that the one I was hidden and pushed off was #Franke. Thinking about it, I still collected one extra. I made up a complete set. I am successful. I hope everyone can drive the one they want most. #Like Luffy, always keep loving like you

Labubu's joint name One Piece can be said to be ecstatic for the two chefs, and the three popular models of the joint series Luffy, Chopper and Zorro are all Ming boxes, so it's not difficult. 	 👑Luffy: The weight belongs to the light echelon, and only chooses from the lightest boxes. The upper and lower half refer to the space, which can be shaken both front, back, left and right, and the left and right space is significantly larger than the front and back. It has a clear feeling of touching the box when it shakes left and right, and there is only one side of the box that touches the box clearly at the bottom. (The touch box point is shown in Figure 2). A very important point is that there is a large bag of desiccant, and the sound is obvious. 	 👑Choba: The weight is the heaviest in the entire series, and it feels obvious when you get it. The upper and lower half refer to the space, and the overall size is full, and it cannot shake left and right. There are very obvious hard tops in front and back. When placed in front and back, the front and back middle and upper top boxes are placed in reverse. When placed in front and back, the front and back middle and lower top boxes are not on the left and right but there is a sense of obstruction. 	 👑Zorro The weight is the lightest in the entire series.  The upper and lower half refer to the space, which can be shaken both front, back, left and right, and the left and right space is significantly larger than the front and back. The middle part of the left and right shake box is obviously touching the box (the point of the box is shown in Figure 3). Accessories are boxed up and down the cover. 	 In general, the three popular models of the Labubu One Piece series are quite obvious. As long as you learn the strategy, you can get it right, and everyone can draw the central wish model! #Adults also want to play with toys #Popular Mart #Blind box touch sharing #One Piece #Luffy #Choba #Zoro #Labubu #Labubu One Piece

Hers was 1412g, and mine was 1359g. It felt like it was a good idea. As a result, it was hidden in my end, weighing 100g. I felt it was hidden when I got it. I couldn't shake it with my hands. There was a little space up and down, there was no space in front and back, and there was a trace of space on the left and right, and there was only the sound of desiccant. I pressed hard in Luffy's ears and felt a sense of obstruction, but it was not hard to push P3, but it was hidden to push Trafalgar Ro.

#Hardcore authors’ plan to get out of the circle. Today I will bring it to you. Labubu Navigation Co-branded Series. Hot model: Luffy's touch guide! 1. Choose a light box, which is one of the lightest babies in the entire series. This box has a net weight of 84.7 grams. 2. It can be shaken up and down, about a finger space. 3. It can be shaking clearly in front and behind, and the space is not very large. 4. When shaking back and forth, there is a noticeable box on the back of the box. 5. The box is placed on the back of this box, concentrated in the middle area of ​​the box. 6. The left and right can be shaken obviously, and the space is slightly larger than the front and back. 7. When shaking left and right, there is a clear boxing feel at the name of the Robin on the right. 8. There must be a countertop! 	 Hope it will be helpful for everyone to draw a box!

Today I am rare to replenish the goods. Everyone is robbing me. I silently retreated and shake the second generation of Ono/Fourth generation. If everyone doesn’t rob, they run to shake the others. Just as the clerk wants to replenish the new box, he goes over to shake it. He doesn’t know whether to be angry or laugh at his luck. This series is the first time I shake it seriously. The first box I took is very similar to what everyone said. Although I feel like I’m using the accessories to box, Qingman is really too similar. I give it to my friend to shake it. I opened the box at the bottom to prove my innocence. In order to prove my innocence, I asked the clerk to take it back. As a result, it was confirmed that it was hidden😶‍🌫️ I took a photo and just pretend I once owned it #popmart #labubu #labubu One Piece #Hidden Luffy #Five-level Luffy

Friends and friends! Who bought the blind box of the labubu✖️One Piece series? ! (Who said that I didn’t buy it at that time? There is no spot in online and offline now!) The price is better than I thought, and there are even two 90+ models! A 100+ model is not the same as the 10 yuan small 🌶️ I thought, but overall it is still a small amount! 	 Have you all entered this series? How do you think the future will develop?

My mouth couldn't be closed... I rushed to the store in the morning and was told that there was no offline goods. I passed by the subway station and saw that there was stock in the robot store.
