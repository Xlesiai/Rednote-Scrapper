Super detailed painless hand guide!
	
1. Choose a box that is lighter or medium-weight, generally within the weight range of 99 grams but 106 grams. This box has a net weight of 99.9 grams, with a net weight of 95.2 grams.
(Because this box is a small package of desiccant, which is medium-weight. If you put more than 10 grams of desiccant, the box will be about 105 grams of medium-weight)
2. It cannot shake up and down completely. It feels like the baby is stuffed very full, and only the sound of desiccant can be heard, because the baby is very wide and can easily get stuck in the box, causing it to shake up and down.
3. There is no movement in front and back, and you can only hear the sound of desiccant on the back of this box.
4. When shaking left and right, you can't feel the baby's body shaking, and you can only hear the sound of the card and desiccant on the back of the box shaking.
5. Press the left and right sides of the box and the middle area, and the creaking feel of the packaging bag. Because the baby is very large, it is easy to spread the packaging bag, causing a bulging feel. This box does not have a clear hard feel.
6. There must be a countertop!
Hope it will be helpful for everyone to draw a box!
