Stamping ~I drew it today, and the touch is quite clear. Remember the following points:

2. The overall size is full, but not completely unable to shake. There is about 1 finger distance on the left and right, and it is not too shaking in front and back, and half a finger in the upper and lower space.
3. Grab the key❗️When shaking left and right, there is a clear box-touching feeling on the barcode and attention on the left, but the touch is not a simple box-touching sound, but a soft box-touching sound (as shown in Figure 2)
4. Grab the key❗️Press the obvious top box in the upper left corner of the front (the feel is relatively unique) Press the slight top box near Labubu's face (as shown in Figure 3)THE MONSTERS ✖️Neighbor

Labubu Navigation Co-branded Series Hidden Model:
Labubu Luffy fifth gear!
Super detailed painless hand guide!
	
1. Choose a box that is lighter or medium-weight, generally within the weight range of 99 grams but 106 grams. This box has a net weight of 99.9 grams, with a net weight of 95.2 grams.
(Because this box is a small package of desiccant, which is medium-weight. If you put more than 10 grams of desiccant, the box will be about 105 grams of medium-weight)
2. It cannot shake up and down completely. It feels like the baby is stuffed very full, and only the sound of desiccant can be heard, because the baby is very wide and can easily get stuck in the box, causing it to shake up and down.
3. There is no movement in front and back, and you can only hear the sound of desiccant on the back of this box.
4. When shaking left and right, you can't feel the baby's body shaking, and you can only hear the sound of the card and desiccant on the back of the box shaking.
5. Press the left and right sides of the box and the middle area, and the creaking feel of the packaging bag. Because the baby is very large, it is easy to spread the packaging bag, causing a bulging feel. This box does not have a clear hard feel.
6. There must be a countertop!
Hope it will be helpful for everyone to draw a box!

Don’t miss it if you like One Piece and labubu🎉 ps: It’s okay to miss it. It’s a bit difficult to comment...This time, I really have two fans. I have seen labubu's various One Piece image drawings before, and it was realized when the anime was about to end.It would be great if the One Piece series could be made into multiple IPs. It won’t become a permanent resident of the leek box again.I just wanted to join in the fun and try out the popular Luffy or Chopper. I clicked into the mini program and randomly ranked third. The first two didn't buy it. I still had a whole box of water. I shook it around and started to use the prompt cards. Suddenly, a box popped up and prompted a hidden or Franky. I decisively took it! ! I'm done~~🏆Hot items 1⃣ Monkey D. Luffy 2⃣ Roronoa Zoro 3⃣ Tony Tony Chopper 🥇Front-end class 4⃣ Brook 5⃣ Trafalgar Law 6⃣ Sanji 🥈Middle-end class 7⃣ Sabo 8⃣ Liar 9⃣ Nico Robin 🥉Back-end class🔟Franky 1⃣ Nami 2⃣ JinbeSo cute! How can I not buy it up?The two chefs are ecstatic and decisively win the box with good prices~
Old 🏴‍☠️Haimi went to the store to see the real thing, and she really did a good job, so she decisively collected the whole set. She couldn't let go of her hands~The big-headed dolls are heavy, and they like the cards and Bailey trays very much. She has never felt much about Luffy's fifth-level Nika state, so it doesn't matter if it doesn't hide. These 12 original states are very good!Take both of them away and see who is the leekThree bones were placed on the work station to accompany me to work (person •͈ᴗ•͈)
Labubu's posture is a bit hunched when he gets it. He can't see his face when looking down at the normal angle. When taking photos, he needs to be super low on the camera. He realizes that the bones are too high and cannot be straight-up, otherwise he will not be able to put them in the blind box.Some time ago, I didn’t buy the sweetheart even if I took a step away. I got nothing when I grabbed the water lily. I casually lined up a box with a few people. My roommate at the front foot was still asking me what I’m most profitable now. The random prompt of the back foot could be a hidden person. I was so excited!⚠️This set of Labubu Yokoyama Hiroshi is really so handsome! ! ! A male friend who doesn’t play with blind boxes is also handsome by this abandoned mecha! ! Not to mention me! Little daughter! ! Just rush to do it! !

I still underestimated the labubu. Last night I found that I could no longer buy the wholesale, so I could only place a single box and decisively placed a four-order single box. I went to pick up the goods today, and I felt something was wrong when I shook one of them. There was no space up or down, and there was a vague plastic shell. Isn’t this hiding the feel!
『Weight』: 126.3g, calculated as the weight of the middle echelon
"Touch": There is no space up and down, and there is also a top (can be pressed to the plastic shell), and you can feel the plastic shell slightly when you shake it. The left and right are not moved as a whole, and the front and back are slightly moved, and only touch the box on the back (such as p2)
"Place": See p2, it is placed obliquely in the box, the whole is a columnar, without any accessories.

pm for more detailsAfter get off work, I passed by Joy City, went into the store and swayed the box. There was no familiar touch on the counter. Finally, I couldn't see me by passing by Labubu, and I couldn't put it down if I picked it up. Isn't this a hidden touch shared by the great gods?In addition to the hidden model Luffy, there are three more expensive models, namely Chopper, Luffy and Zoro.

Tony Tony Chopper
1. Choose the heaviest box, which is the heaviest baby in the entire series. This box has a net weight of 129.6 grams and a net weight of 126.5 grams.
(Because the net weight of this baby is already very heavy, usually about 3 grams of small packets of desiccant are added)
2. You can shake up and down, about a little finger space.
3. The box feels very heavy and the second half is very heavy.
4. You can only shake slightly in front and back, only a little space.
5. The left and right can hardly shake, and only the sound of desiccant shaking can be heard.
6. Press the lower area around the box hard, which will make the feel of some hard objects, which is caused by the antlers on the head.

I was always worried about whether this would be too insincere and not going to get it in person, whether labubu would not like lazy people. My boyfriend said that we had Lizi Coco and Quduoduo's mysterious guests would want to come to our big family. In this way, Huolala brought this mysterious guest to my house!

I tried the disassembly problem. The accessories of Happy Factor and Surprise Special Shake are connected by wire, and all of them can be removed, and you can do it with your hands! Hiding is not that easy to remove, the lid can be removed, and I can't understand the lower body (not sure if there is a complete lower body). It has a complex structure, I don't plan to challenge it if I am afraid of being damaged, hahahaha
	
Huolala must be praised here! Cheaper than all errands! The same distance between Hummingbird Meituan Dada is about 40, Huolala is only 31, so I was not in a hurry, so I called 22 yuan to send it. I was shocked. I made an appointment in the morning. I originally thought I could just deliver it before going out in the evening, but it was there in less than an hour.It's really a bright box! ! ! !
⭐Weight: 131.9g
⭐Touch: Can shake up and down a little, can't shake left and right at all, and box front and back. The box point is not very obvious when shaking the front and back, but the box point is obvious when shaking the box point is backward (as shown in Figure 4).
The left and right are obvious! (See Figure 2 and Figure 3)
The card and desiccant are at the back, and the sound of the card is very obvious.
The box is placed as shown in Figure 6.

After a year, I drew a hot owl again. Let’s share the feel of the two draws~
1️⃣Pick the heaviest two or three
2️⃣There is magnetic attraction❗️ (sneaky test for the app) The magnetic attraction value is about 70➕
3️⃣Shake up and down and there is a lot of space
4️⃣Boxing boxes in front, back, left and right, and there are obvious boxing points, so there is no way to pinch things around
	
✨ Pay attention to distinguishing business hours:
✔️Magnetic value is 100➕, larger than an owl
✔️Boxing the box front, back, left and right is one piece instead of one dot
✔️ And the weight is slightly smaller than that of the owl
There are many series of comics in the store, you can try it outForest town, one store manager unpacks the box and not the bag
