I have no box machines. Who would have thought of passing by the box machines when I went shopping. I happened to meet the staff who were loading the goods. I watched 12 of them. As soon as the staff left, my husband ran to push them excitedly. I didn\u2019t think about buying too much at the beginning, so I bought 4. I just wanted to drive out #Luffy or #Chopa. The result was not very much. But without repeating this, we had a premonition that the goods on it were definitely a whole box. I simply pushed them all and pushed them to the 7th. My son opened his little hand and opened it to hide\u203c \ufe0fInstantly exclaimed. Who knows how to feel hidden for the first time after entering the pit for so long? I am still the box machine. I have been driven one after another. I found that the one I was hidden and pushed off was #Franke. Thinking about it, I still collected one extra. I made up a complete set. I am successful. I hope everyone can drive the one they want most. #Like Luffy, always keep loving like you\n------------------------------------------------------------",

        "Labubu's joint name One Piece can be said to be ecstatic for the two chefs, and the three popular models of the joint series Luffy, Chopper and Zorro are all Ming boxes, so it's not difficult. \t \ud83d\udc51Luffy: The weight belongs to the light echelon, and only chooses from the lightest boxes. The upper and lower half refer to the space, which can be shaken both front, back, left and right, and the left and right space is significantly larger than the front and back. It has a clear feeling of touching the box when it shakes left and right, and there is only one side of the box that touches the box clearly at the bottom. (The touch box point is shown in Figure 2). A very important point is that there is a large bag of desiccant, and the sound is obvious. \t \ud83d\udc51Choba: The weight is the heaviest in the entire series, and it feels obvious when you get it. The upper and lower half refer to the space, and the overall size is full, and it cannot shake left and right. There are very obvious hard tops in front and back. When placed in front and back, the front and back middle and upper top boxes are placed in reverse. When placed in front and back, the front and back middle and lower top boxes are not on the left and right but there is a sense of obstruction. \t \ud83d\udc51Zorro The weight is the lightest in the entire series.  The upper and lower half refer to the space, which can be shaken both front, back, left and right, and the left and right space is significantly larger than the front and back. The middle part of the left and right shake box is obviously touching the box (the point of the box is shown in Figure 3). Accessories are boxed up and down the cover. \t In general, the three popular models of the Labubu One Piece series are quite obvious.

        "#Keloulifeng brings you today. A popular model in the Labubu One Piece co-branded series. Labubu Chopper! A collection of super detailed touch guides! \t Tony Tony Chopper 1. Choose the heaviest box, which is the heaviest baby in the entire series. This box has a net weight of 129.6 grams and a net weight of 126.5 grams. (Because the net weight of this baby is already very heavy, usually about 3 grams of small packets of desiccant are placed) 2. It can be shaken up and down, about a little finger space. 3. The box feels very heavy and the second half is very heavy. 4. You can only shake slightly in front and back, only a little space. 5. The left and right can hardly shake, and only the sound of desiccant shaking can be heard. 6. Press the lower area around the box hard, which will make the feel of some hard objects, which is caused by the antlers on the head. \t Hope it will be helpful for everyone to draw a box.
